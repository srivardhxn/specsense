"""
RAG layer: ingest provided datasets/reference artifacts and retrieve
relevant chunks for a product BEFORE falling back to live web search.

This directly answers the brief's "supporting datasets and reference
artifacts may also be provided" line, and gives you a real, demoable
RAG story: "for provided/known data we retrieve locally and instantly;
for unknown parts we fall back to live discovery."

Implementation note: uses TF-IDF + cosine similarity (scikit-learn)
rather than a downloaded embedding model. This is a deliberate choice
for hackathon reliability -- no large model download over conference
wifi, no external embedding API cost, and it's fast to set up. It is
a legitimate, explainable retrieval method (you can literally show
judges which keywords matched). If you have reliable internet on demo
day and want to upgrade to semantic embeddings (sentence-transformers
or an API embedding model), swap out `_vectorize()` -- everything else
in this file stays the same.
